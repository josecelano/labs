# Lab #6: Testing

Your task in this lab is to get the todo list from the last lab to **100% test coverage**. (we've pre-filled the solution from the last lab, you won't have to do that again.)

**Do not cheat by looking at old labs again!** That would hurt your learning experience, and on top of that none of them have 100% coverage anyway.

## Testing

There is no test for this lab! (duh) We've enabled test coverage output, so when you run `npm run test` it outputs the percentage of your app that you've covered in your tests.
