# Lab #6: Testing

Your task in this lab is to get the todo list from the last lab to **100% test coverage and be thoroughly tested**. (we've pre-filled the solution from the last lab, you won't have to do that again.) This is what your console output should look like when you're done:

**Do not cheat by looking at old labs again or by using anything other than shallow rendering!** That would hurt your learning experience, so please resist the temptation. We want you to think through this now so you can do it for your own apps afterwards!

## Testing

There is no test for this lab! (duh) We've enabled test coverage output (by passing the `--coverage` option to Jest), so when you run `npm run test` it outputs the percentage of your app that you've covered in your tests.
