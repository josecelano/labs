# Lab #7: Higher Order Components

This lab is split into three parts which can be found in these branches:
- 7-1-hoc
- 7-2-hoc
- 7-3-hoc

# Part 3

Your task in this lab is to create a higher order component to show warning in case the `value` of an Input component has less then x characters. The amount of minimum required characters must be provided when the Input component is wrapped.

You need to fill out the `withMinLengthValidation.js`. You can see how this higher order component is used in `index.js`.

```sh
index.js                   # Renders a Counter wrapped by withMinLengthValidation
withMinLengthValidation.js # This should export the higher order component
```

With `npm start` you can run the application, but it will fail until you implemented `withMinLengthValidation`.

## Testing

To make it easier for you to complete this task, we've added snapshot tests verifying that you've arrived at the correct app. This command will run the tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

If you haven't changed anything you should see two test failures saying "Component is not a function"â€”that's because there's nothing in the `TodoList.js` and `TodoItem.js` files yet! Once you've put components into them you'll see exactly what we're expecting the components to do.
